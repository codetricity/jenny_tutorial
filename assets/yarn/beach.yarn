Ken: Oh, hi Akemi.
Akemi: It's Ken, right?
Ken: Yes.  It's great to see you again.
Akemi: Are you enjoying the cruise?
Ken: It's great to hang out with my grandparents, but it can be a bit boring.
Akemi: Well, maybe it'll get more exciting if you go into town.
Ken: Are you going into town?
Akemi: I'm actually going on a zip line tour in the forest.
Ken: Well, have fun.
Akemi: You too.
